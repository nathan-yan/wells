# Wells Gradient Descent
The goal of the wells problem is to distribute a limited number of wells among a randomly placed population, such that the summed distance of each person's distance to the nearest well is minimize. I used a number of gradient descent approaches, including vanilla GD, GD with Momentum, as well as a center-of-mass heuristic that my friend Alex Mallen came up with.
